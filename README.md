# The Monkey Forest

This project represents a forest of monkeys.

The monkeys come into being as the forest is generated, and in the next version the monkeys will move around.

As they have two sexes, `true` and `false`, when two monkeys happen to share a tree, there is a chance they may
reproduce. If that happens, on the next move there will be 3 monkeys in the tree!

The forest is not fussy, while it currently is filled with trees, it could easily be filled with bushes,
or huts, or anything else. The trees are also not fussy, so additional animals would be possible without any major
changes.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
